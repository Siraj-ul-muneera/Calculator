# Calculator

Java code to create a calculator to perform the four basic arithmetic operations
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

## Steps to run the calculator
* To use the application you need to run the **MainApp.java** class
* You would be prompted to enter an arithmetic expression as the input.
* The input is then validated. In case you have entered an invalid input, the same would be displayed.
* If the input is valid, you would see the result or the numerical value obtained after evaluating the arithmetic expression.
